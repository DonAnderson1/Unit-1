# Case Study 1
The CEO and CFO of Budweiser (the client) have hired ADJ Analytics to answer the 7 questions listed below and beyond those general questions we have 
speculated / anticipated additional questions that what may be of interest to them. Our client only has had one class in statistics and have indicated that 
we cannot take more than 7 minutes of their time. 

1.   How many breweries are present in each state?
2.   Merge beer data with the breweries data. Print the first 6 observations and the last six observations to check the merged file. (RMD only, this does        not need to be included in the presentation or the deck.)
3.   Address the missing values in each column.
4.   Compute the median alcohol content and international bitterness unit for each state. Plot a bar chart to compare.
5.   Which state has the maximum alcoholic (ABV) beer? Which state has the most bitter (IBU) beer?
6.   Comment on the summary statistics and distribution of the ABV variable.
7.   Is there an apparent relationship between the bitterness of the beer and its alcoholic content? Draw a scatter plot. Make your best judgment of a          relationship and EXPLAIN your answer.
